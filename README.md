What is it?
-------------

This is a simple webpage.  Put it on a server to host it, or just open it 
straight from your desktop if you don't want to host it.  Assuming you are on 
your desktop, try double-clicking standup.html

How do I use it?
------------------

To use the 'app' itself, click the start button.  In 60 min it'll make a dialog 
that tells you to go do something else.  Acknowledge the dialog to start another
timer that will create a dialog to remind you to sit down after a couple 
minutes.

Of course, if you are using this properly, you won't be around to see the second
 dialog, but that is more of a people problem than something that can be solved 
 with an app
