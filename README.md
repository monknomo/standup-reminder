==========
This is a simple webpage.  Put it on a server to host it, or just open it 
straight from your desktop if you don't want to host it.

To use the 'app' itself, click the start button.  In 60 min it'll make a dialog 
that tells you to go do something else.  Acknowledge the dialog to start another
timer that will create a dialog to remind you to sit down after a couple 
minutes.

Of course, if you are using this properly, you won't be around to see the second
 dialog, but that is more of a people problem than something that can be solved 
 with an app
